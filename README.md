# Text-Generation with GPT-2

This project fine-tunes the GPT-2 language model to generate coherent and context-aware text based on custom training data.
It demonstrates how to preprocess data, fine-tune using Hugging Face Transformers, and generate meaningful outputs.
The goal is to mimic the style and structure of the input dataset for personalized text generation.
Ideal for tasks like story generation, chatbots, or domain-specific content creation.
